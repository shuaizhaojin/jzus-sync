# JZUS-B Article Categories

The categories of frequently published articles in Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B (Biomedicine & Biotechnology) (JZUS-B for short) include, but are not limited to, Preview, Perspective, Article, Review or Mini-review, Correspondence, and Editorial. Detailed in-formation is given below:

## Preview
Preview, also known as "Communication" or "Letter", is to rapidly and concisely present a preliminary study, which has innovative research findings or a novel idea, but might be less substantial than a full research article. Previews should have no more than 2000 words (excluding references and figure legends) and 2 display items (figures and/or tables). There is no ab-stract, but the opening paragraph should provide enough information to attract reader's attention and allow them to understand the study. Previews may be commissioned or unsolicited submissions, and will be peer-reviewed and published as a high priority.

## Perspective
Perspective is to give an opinion on virtually any important popular topic. We welcome a personal viewpoint on new advances or giving fresh insights. Viewpoints should be well focused, scholarly, and clearly presented. Maximum length is up to 2000 words (excluding references and figure legends), with 2 display items (figures and/or tables). There is no abstract, but the opening paragraph should provide your readers with sufficient information. Perspectives may be commissioned or unsolicited submissions, and will be peer-reviewed and published as a high priority.

## Article
Article is a substantial novel research study. It is written by the researchers who actually conducted the study and reviewed by international peer scholars. The researchers describe the research question and the purpose of the study in the Introduction, detail their methods in Materials and Methods, report the findings in Results, and interpret the results and implications in Discussion, followed by genuine conclusions, which are not just a repeat of the abstract or summary of results. A structured abstract should have 150-300 words. An article may have up to 10 display items (figures and/or tables). Conciseness is encouraged, while currently there is no length limit on a research article. Additional related materials, if necessary, may be provided as electronic supplementary materials. Authors are required to provide a competing financial interests, ethics, and author contributions statement.

## Review or Mini-review
Review or Mini-review should be authoritative and of high interest. A review normally has some 5000 words, while some 3000 words are required for a mini-review, excluding references and figure legends. Display items (figures and/or tables) are welcomed. An abstract should have 100-200 words. Authors are required to provide a competing financial interests statement. Leading researchers are encouraged to write high-quality reviews in their fields. Reviews may be commissioned or unsolicited submissions and are reviewed by international peer scholars.

## Correspondence
Correspondence, also known as "Letter to the Editor", covers a wide variety of contents, which are too brief to be published as abovementioned article categories. The authors can provide rapid and concise report of important findings, discuss controversial and interdisciplinary topics or any other issues of interest, or give some comments on papers previously published. It is limited to 1500 words and 15 references. Only 1-2 display items (figures and/or tables) are allowed. There is no abstract or any subsections; nevertheless, the opening paragraph should present concise but yet sufficient information to give the reader a basic overview. Additional related materials, if necessary, may be provided as electronic supplementary materials. Correspondence will be reviewed by Editorial Board members and published as a high priority.

## Editorial
Editorial is written by members of the editorial board of JZUS-B, the journal editors, guest editor(s) of a special issue, or invited distinguished scholars. Editorials are meant to influence public opinion, promote critical thinking, and sometimes cause people to take action on an issue.
